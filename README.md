## Earnings Report Strategy
# Motivation
Pursuing opportunities with higher volatility offers the potential for greater returns. Earnings dates are inherently volatile, and developing a deep understanding of their behavior can provide long-term benefits, both in terms of knowledge and financial outcomes. Initially, I propose leveraging readily available pre-earnings factors and applying informed judgment to assess the viability of trades. However, given that earnings-based strategies are widely studied, much of the anticipated movement is likely already reflected in the market price of well-established stocks. To counter this, our focus will shift towards smaller, less-followed companies, where market inefficiencies may present more favorable opportunities.
